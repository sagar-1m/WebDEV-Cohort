# What is PolyFill?

Polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively. Flattening the API landscape if you will.

Polyfill is a term coined by Remy Sharp to describe a piece of code that detects if a certain browser lacks a feature, and provides a workaround for that feature.

## Polyfill is usually JavaScript code used to fill in the gap between the browser's native support for a feature and the developer's expectation that the feature should be available in all browsers.

## How does Polyfill work?

Polyfill works by detecting if a certain browser lacks a feature, and providing a workaround for that feature. This is done by checking if a certain feature is available in the browser, and if it is not, the polyfill will provide a workaround for that feature.

## Why use Polyfill?

Polyfill is used to provide a workaround for features that are not available in all browsers. This is done by providing a piece of code that will provide the feature in the browser that lacks it.

## How to use Polyfill?

Polyfill is usually included in the HTML file using a script tag. The script tag will include the polyfill code, and the polyfill will be executed when the page is loaded.
