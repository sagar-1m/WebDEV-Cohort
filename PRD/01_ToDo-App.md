## Why is PRD important?

Imagine planning a road trip from Delhi to Goa without a map. Sounds chaotic, right? Similarly, jumping into product development without a PRD can lead to confusion, wasted time, and missed goals.

### A PRD helps you:

- **Clarify your objectives.** 🎯
- **Define the scope of your project.** 🗂️
- **Align your team (even if it's just you!).** 🤝
- **Stay focused on what's important.** 🔍
